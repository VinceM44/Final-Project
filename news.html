        <h2>California sues Uber and Lyft</h2>
        <p>The Attorney General of California has issued a lawsuit against Uber and Lyft. The lawsuit claims that the companies have illegally treated their drivers as independent contractors, which deprives them of worker protections and benefits like minimum wage.
            If it is won by the state, Uber and Lyft will have to pay restitution for unpaid wages and will be forced to classify all of their drivers as employees.
            The state argues that Uber and Lyft gave themselves an unfair market advantage by dodging expenses including drivers' wages and local and state payroll taxes. This lawsuit stems from California's Assembly Bill 5, which established stricter standards for which workers can be treated as independent contractors rather than employees.

            Lyft gave a positive response saying that they are "looking forward to working with the Attorney General and mayors across the state to bring all the venefits of Californis's innovation economy to as many workers as possible".
            Uber also gave a respose saying they will still contest the action in court but still try and raise the standard for independent workers. Drivers, along with labor groups, who have been calling for the state to enforce the Assembly Bill, are estatic over the lawsuit.
            Even if Uber and Lyft win the lawsuit, it is likely that conditions for the drivers will improve. So it's a win-win for them.
