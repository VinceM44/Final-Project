    <h2>2018-2019 season</h2>
    <p>The previous season for the New York Giants was terrible, and most people expected it. It all started before the season started... the draft. We had the option of one of the best QBs on the board in Dwayne Haskins, or we could select Josh Allen to strengthen our defense.
        Instead, we chose Daniel Jones, the inevitable replacement for Eli Manning. Not many fans were happy about this pick, until the preseason when Daniel Jones showed promising signs. Regardless of the draft, hopes for a decent season were high with a veteran quaterback at the helm 
        and of course the explosive running back, Saquon Barkley, who had a great rookie season.

        With some mixed feelings about how the Giants would perform, the regular season got underway. Quickly, all hope of a good season was lost when the Giants started off with two straight losses. They needed a spark, something to get them going. So, for the second time in his carrer,
        Eli Manning was benched, and in came Daniel Jones. It seemed like that was just the spark the team needed because they won the next two games with Jones under center. But that spark was short-lived as they lost the next eight games in-a-row. To make matters worse, Saquon wasn't performing
        nearly as well as he had the year before and even ended up getting injured week three, as would Jones week thirteen. The injury to Jones meant the return of Eli for a couple of games. Everyone knew Eli's time in New York was coming to an end and these last two games would be his last.
        After a loss to the Eagles and a win over the Dolphins, fans said goodbye to Eli with a standing ovation, and Eli would announce his retirement after the season ended. The Giants finished the season 4-12 and have little hopes of making it to the post-season this year. But with a successful draft, fans are hopeful for at least a better record.
